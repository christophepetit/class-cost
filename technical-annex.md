## 1	S&T EXCELLENCE

### 1.1	Soundness of the Challenge 

TODO: Ben

#### 1.1.1	DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE-OF-THE-ART
#### 1.1.2	DESCRIPTION OF THE CHALLENGE (MAIN AIM)


### 1.2	Progress beyond the state-of-the-art 

TODO: Chloe (Chloe: I'll work on this properly after Ben has written the state-of-the-art so that things are somewhat unified)

#### 1.2.1	APPROACH TO THE CHALLENGE AND PROGRESS BEYOND THE STATE-OF-THE-ART

To include:
-Book from summer school
-Cryptanalysis workshop(s)? + focussed workshop
-Development of new protocols by dedicated WG on number-theoretic foundations
-Implementation dedicated WG and focussed workshop(s)
-Database focussed workshop (follow-up from implementation or combined?)
-STSMs (e.g. to foster research connections formed at workshops??)

#### 1.2.2	Objectives

**TODO**

##### 1.2.2.1 Research Coordination Objectives

- Developing the field of isogeny-based cryptography both by improving the understanding of the existing protocols and by developing new protocols.
- Leading the development of a common understanding internationally of both classical and quantum algorithms applied to isogeny-based cryptosystems.
- Create an open-source database of isogeny formulas. This naturally complements and can be included in the already widely-used Explicit Formulas Database (https://hyperelliptic.org/EFD/). **TODO** check with Tanja.
- Write a book on isogeny-based cryptography covering the basic topics needed for a newcomer to the topic to start doing research in the area.
- Disseminate the work acheived through COST collaborations by presenting at high-profile international cryptography conferences such as Eurocrypt.
- Input to international standards on post-quantum cryptography such as the ongoing competition being led by NIST.


What we discussed:
- Dissemination
- Development of common understanding
- Input to marketers
- Input to stakeholders (e.g., NIST)?
- Data curation?

##### 1.2.2.2 Capacity-building Objectives

- Growing the field of isogeny-based cryptography by fostering existing research connections. As this is an emerging field, no one country has a critical mass of isogeny-based cryptography reseachers. Most of the innovative papers (about 1 per year) resulted from multinational collaboration, and a research network will allow for a rapid increase in research output.
- Bringing together reseachers from cryptography, number theory, and quantum computing, all of whom have relevant and different perspectives on the major open problems in isogeny-based cryptography.
- Allowing Early Career Investigators who would otheriwse be isolated or limited to very few local collaborators to connect with the whole European isogeny-based cryptography community.
- Promoting and supporting female and non-binary researchers in the field, both by a having a diverse consortium with respect to gender (at each level of involvement), and by collaboration with the Women in Numbers Europe community.

What we discussed:
- Bridging fields
- Building new stuff

## 3	IMPACT

The aim of the Action is to expand the impact of isogenies on future
communication technologies. By creating the conditions to adopt,
safely and cost-effectively, isogeny-based protocols in future
communication protocols, the Action will positively impact the
competitiveness of SMEs and large companies in Europe and beyond.

The action will seek to maximise impact by disseminating results in
written form (books, academic papers, whitepapers, blog posts), and by
forming a new generation of young researchers and engineers to the
fundamental tools of isogeny-based cryptography.


### 3.1	IMPACT TO SCIENCE, SOCIETY AND COMPETITIVENESS, AND POTENTIAL FOR INNOVATION/BREAK-THROUGHS

#### 3.1.1	SCIENTIFIC, TECHNOLOGICAL, AND/OR SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACTS (INCLUDING POTENTIAL INNOVATIONS AND/OR BREAKTHROUGHS)

NIST's eventual standardization of SIKE, possibly at some point within
the time frame of the Action, or shortly thereafter, is the first
clear impact factor tied to the Action. Through its published
analyses, the Action will aim at influencing NIST's decision
process. Two outcomes are possible: either the analyses shed doubt on
the security of SIKE, an unfortunate outcome, but a valuable
contribution to NIST and to society; or they confirm the strength of
SIKE, and possibly improve its performance, hopefully leading to
widespread adoption and to growth in the sector of
post-quantum cryptography.

While the eventual standardization of SIKE would be an undeniable
booster for the popularity of isogeny-based cryptogrpahy, the Action
goals reach beyond NIST's competition and post-quantum
cryptography alone. 

Within the scope of post-quantum cryptography, it is hoped that the
Action will contribute to significant innovations, such as, for
example, efficient isogeny-based signature schemes, new advanced
primitives not currently known to be constructible from isogenies,
better provable security for already known primitives, or more
in-depth analyses of available attacks. Although on a longer
time-scale than SIKE, these innovations will directly benefit
stakeholders operating in the post-quantum space such as SMEs and
large companies offering encrypted products with long-term security.

Beyond post-quantum cryptography, the recently discovered "time delay
protocols" based on isogenies offer another opportunity for high
impact, providing cost-effective solutions to difficult problems in
distributed computing such as generation of fair randomness or
electronic voting. The primary beneficiaries of these technologies are
stakeholders working with blockchains, and more generally financial
services. The Action will advance the state of the art of time delay
protocols: providing more powerful constructions, more efficient
protocols, and more secure instantiations.

Finally, in terms of scientific impact, the goal of the action is to
establish a common language and to reach a critical mass capable of
accelerating progress in isogeny-based cryptography. The various
actions described in the implementation section (workshops, schools,
books) will contribute to form a new generation of experts with a deep
understanding of isogeny-based cryptography, whose impact in the
broader fields of theoretical and applied cryptography will be felt
well after the Action is over.

### 3.2	MEASURES TO MAXIMISE IMPACT

#### 3.2.1	KNOWLEDGE CREATION, TRANSFER OF KNOWLEDGE AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT

Owing to its interdisciplinary nature, and to the wide range of skills
involved, the Action will alternate large meetings aimed at all
partners and smaller focused meetings gathering participants from one
or two Working Groups.

Concretely, the Action will be structured around yearly meetings, in
rotating locations, aimed at all participants and open to outside
researchers. The meeting will have both an educational component, in
the form of lectures, and a research one, in the form of contributed
talks, posters, and work sessions. To encourage outside participation,
the Action will seek to co-locate the meetings with related
conferences, e.g., Eurocrypt or ANTS. Lecturers will be encouraged to
write lecture notes, and the notes will be collected on the website of
the Action [or shall we try to publish proceedings?]. Whenever
technically possible, measures will be taken to encourage remote
participation; at a minimum, lectures will be recorded and made
available online shortly after the workshop.

Between yearly meetings, the action will organize smaller workshops or
schools focused on narrower topics, typically involving one or two
Working Groups. The workshops will primarily be targeted at Action
members, but will be open to anyone, within the capacity of the event.
Whenever feasible, these workshops will be organized in participating
Inclusiveness Target Countries, to facilitate participation of
researchers from these. The format of the workshop will be decided by
the organizers, and will have to be validated by the Management
Committee.

Both in the organization of the meetings and of the workshops, the
Action will strive to involve early career researchers in their
organization, in particular from Inclusiveness Target Countries, to
encourage responsibility taking and network building.

A limited amount of Short-Term Scientific Missions and Conference
Grants will be reserved to encourage PhD students to visit other
institutions and develop scientific collaborations.


#### 3.2.2	PLAN FOR DISSEMINATION AND/OR EXPLOITATION AND DIALOGUE WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR POLICY

Selected lectures from the schools, plus invited essays if necessary,
will be invited to become chapters of a book edited under the
supervision of the Action and published with an academic publisher. 

-book
-videos
- whitepapers
- blog posts

Present a clear and attainable plan for dissemination and/or
exploitation of results, including IPR, if relevant. Describe a plan
for dissemination and/or exploitation of results that is clear and
attainable and contributesto the dialogue between science and the
general public and/or policy

the main goal of the Action is
to form a new generation of experts in isogeny-based cryptography.  It
is indeed a commonly held belief that isogenies are a highly technical
topic, much harder to master than any other object currently used in
cryptography.  It is a fact that development in isogeny-based
cryptography is currently being held back by the small size of the
community and by the scarce availability of accessible literature
introducing the topic, especially for students coming from other
backgrounds than number theory. Through its dissemination actions
(workshops, schools, research visits), and its publications (lecture
notes, books), the Action will contribute to establish a common
language and bring together researchers from different backgrounds to
