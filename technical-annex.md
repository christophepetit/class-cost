# TECHNICAL ANNEX

## 1	S&T EXCELLENCE

Elliptic curves have been central to the development of number theory throughout the 20th century,
and of public-key cryptography in the 21st century.
Their interest and utility is beyond question.
Contemporary **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**,
which is now ubiquitous in digital security (from the internet to smart cards),
represents a brilliant example
of effective exchange and collaboration
between researchers from pure mathematics (especially number theory and algebraic geometry),
computer science, and engineering.
Now, the new emergence of **isogeny-based cryptography**
requires us to strengthen, broaden, renew, and re-focus this exchange:
this is the goal of the Action.


### 1.1	Soundness of the Challenge 

**Elliptic curves** are simple cubic equations that are a valuable source of groups and representations in number theory.
Since the landmark 1985 works of Koblitz and Miller,
they have gradually become an indispensable tool for cryptographers.
Elliptic-curve cryptosystems are now widely deployed,
and represent the state-of-the-art
for key establishment in secure internet connections,
for digital signature schemes,
and for authentication and encryption in smart cards.

**Isogenies**
are algebraic mappings---essentially, nontrivial algebraic relationships---between elliptic curves.
Isogenies play the elliptic-curve role that matrices play in linear algebra:
for number theorists, they are fundamental to the study of elliptic curves.
Until recently, 
isogenies have played a minor and somewhat hidden role in ECC:
for example, they are crucial in the generation of secure ECC parameters
(in the SEA algorithm),
and they have also been used to map hard cryptographic problems between curves.
However,
it has been possible for researchers to learn and work in ECC without knowing about isogenies.

In the past decade, however, 
a new generation of public-key **isogeny-based cryptosystems** has appeared,
rapidly gaining attention for their apparent resistance to 
adversaries equipped with quantum computers---a quality that classical ECC spectacularly lacks.
Isogeny-based cryptography is the newest of the main paradigms in **post-quantum cryptography**,
but it has already found some success:
one early cryptosystem, SIKE,
has been selected by NIST as an alternate candidate in the third round of its post-quantum cryptography standardization process.

In isogeny-based cryptosystems,

- *security* depends on the difficulty of reconstructing an unknown isogeny with classical and/or quantum computers;
- *utility* depends on highly efficient algorithms and software for computing isogenies; and
- proper *design and analysis* requires a deep understanding of the mathematical and algorithmic nature of isogenies.

From a cryptographic perspective,
our understanding of these three aspects is still rudimentary and immature.
The challenge now facing us is to renew, strengthen, and enlarge
the collaboration between mathematicians, computer scientists,
and engineers that was fundamental to the success of ECC,
in order to better understand and establish the theory and practice of isogeny-based cryptography.

#### 1.1.1	DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE-OF-THE-ART

The beginning of isogeny-based cryptography (as we recognise it today)
goes back to 2006,
with the early public-key cryptosystems sketched by Stolbunov
and the isogeny-based hash function of Charles, Goren, and Lauter.
The first competitive cryptosystem was Jao and De Feo's SIDH (2009) 
post-quantum key exchange algorithm,
which became the basis of the SIKE key encapsulation mechanism (KEM)
submitted to the NIST post-quantum standardization process.
Early research on isogeny-based cryptosystems was mostly focused
on SIDH, its cryptanalysis, and its efficient implementation.
As the most mature of isogeny-based cryptosystems,
SIDH remains an important target.

In recent years, however, Stolbunov's ideas have been revisited,
producing an explosion of new cryptosystems based on the nexus
of isogenies and class field theory.
The most notable such cryptosystem is CSIDH,
which promises to be the first post-quantum solution
for non-interactive key exchange.
The crucial idea is the realisation of cryptosystems
based on *group actions*.

However, the mathematical foundations of Stolbunov's cryptosystems and CSIDH
lend themselves to more detailed constructions.
In particular,
we now have new and efficient isogeny-based digital signature schemes,
such as CSI-FiSh and SQISign,
as well as advanced cryptosystems
including threshold signatures and Verifiable Delay Functions.[^1]

[^1:] This paragraph seems to suggest that SQISign or VDFs are based
on CSIDH, which is wrong.

Conversely, these newer and more complicated cryptosystems
require a more sophisticated security analysis,
both classical and quantum.
For example:
SIDH security depends essentially on a claw-finding problem.
Quantum claw-finding algorithms are relatively well-understood,
and there is something of a consensus on their modelling and projected behaviour.
In contrast,
CSIDH security depends on an abelian hidden shift problem,
which can be solved using Kuperberg's quantum algorithm
with a quantum isogeny-evaluation subroutine;
but so far concrete estimates for the cost of these algorithms
have been wildly divergent.

Going beyond specific cryptosystems,
the development of isogeny-based cryptography 
requires a range of highly non-trivial supporting algorithms.
For example:
the CSI-FiSh signature scheme requires a massive precomputation
of the ideal class group structure of a certain quadratic imaginary ring.
Achieving this for the first proposed parameter set
required a world-record class group computation
by Beullens, Kleinjung, and Vercauteren.
Instantiating schemes like CSI-FiSh
at higher security levels,
or with larger parameters in reaction to revised security estimates
requires cutting-edge techniques in algebraic number theory,
using algorithms that have been largely neglected by cryptographers
for over a decade.

#### 1.1.2	DESCRIPTION OF THE CHALLENGE (MAIN AIM)

To advance and deploy isogeny-based cryptosystems
we require

1. An effective, constructive, and algorithmic understanding 
   of mathematical structures such as quaternion algebras
   which, while common in number theory,
   are poorly-known and understood among ECC reseachers.
1. A better understanding of quantum algorithms,
   both established and new,
   and their application to fundamental problems with isogenies 
   and more broadly in number theory.
1. The development and adaptation of tools and algorithms 
   from algebraic number theory,
   such as class-group computations,
   that have not been used in ECC research before,
   and of which knowledge elsewhere in cryptography has grown stale.
1. More effective and open exchange and transmission of knowledge
   between researchers in cryptography and number theory,
   expanding an interdisciplinary bridge
   built by ECC.
1. Increased interaction between specialists in isogenies
   and theoretical cryptographers,
   with a view to defining new post-quantum protocols
   with solid foundations.
1. A determined and unified effort 
   to demystify isogenies for working cryptographers
   and cryptographic engineers,
   rendering the field accessible to practitioners.

To do this, we propose a European research network of number theorists, cryptographers, and specialists in quantum algorithms.  The network will be built upon a framework for fundamental research and effective communication, both within the network and with the broader international community.

### 1.2	Progress beyond the state-of-the-art 

This action can be reasonably expected to make significant progress beyond the state-of-the-art in three main topics: constructing new protocols, cryptanalysis, and implementation.

We see above that isogenies have proven already to be flexible in their breadth of cryptographic applications: (non-interative) key exchange, signatures, VDFs, and more. 
However, many of the classical cryptographic protocols from later generations, for example using pairings, do not yet have efficient post-quantum analogues. We will have a focussed working group on number-theoretic foundations in order to explore further the potential for new post-quantum as well as classical applications of isogenies; such a study may also lead to improved algorithms for the current popular isogeny-based constructions.

With cryptanalysis it is especially important that the best classical and quantum algorithms to attack isogeny-based cryptosystems are well understood and pushed to their limits, as well as searching for new approaches. By the end of the action, we will have a unified stance on the classical and quantum security of SIKE and CSIDH, as well as more advanced protocols, and have a better understanding of the security of isogeny-based cryptography more generally. This will give much-needed confidence in the schemes before they are implemented on a wide-scale.

Secure and efficient implementation is a very active topic in isogeny-based cryptography. 
Through this action, by the careful creation of databases and coordination of work it will be possible to present secure and optimized implementations for not only the main protocols but also for new constructions. 

#### 1.2.1	APPROACH TO THE CHALLENGE AND PROGRESS BEYOND THE STATE-OF-THE-ART

Our approach to the challenge from the perspective of the network has two main foci: introducing young researchers to the main open problems while equipping them with the tools they will need, and bringing together researchers from different fields to learn from each others' different perspectives. 

Concretely, for the first aim we plan to hold a week-long school near the beginning of the action, 
and to create a book with chapters contributed by the lecturers of this school. The book will be maintained on an open source online platform with possibility for the future addition (or removal) of chapters until the end of the action, 
due to the fact that the topic is still changing rapidly, and will be formally published during the last year of the action.

For the second aim, 
we will bring together reseachers from different fields by means of both dedicate working groups and workshops. 
-For cryptanalysis, we will hold a dedicated workshop, with follow-up workshops focussed on aspects of (classical or quantum) cryptnalysis that prove to be of interest to the partners in the action. 
-For the development of new protocols, we have a dedicated working group on number-theoretic foundations.
-For implementation, we have dedicated working group, and we will also hold implementation focussed workshops throughout the action.
This will include a workshop dedicated to the creation of a database for isogeny formulas.

Finally, we will support Short-Term Scientific Missions, especially to foster research connections formed at the aforementioned workshops, throughout the entire action period.
These missions will be vital for the continuation of the research inspired by our workshops, and especially prioritise mobility for young researchers and participants who do not have access to alternate travel funding.

#### 1.2.2	Objectives

Although isogeny-based cryptography is still very much an emerging field, the time pressure of achieving post-quantum cryptographic standards
and the resource benefits of using isogeny-based cryptosystems are facilitating the possibility of relatively early wide-scale adoption of
isogeny-based cryptosystems. Our objectives, listed below, aim to mitigate the risk of early adoption where possible as well as develop a 
unified global outlook in the field. In particular, no one country involved in the Action (or indeed globally) has a critical mass of
isogeny-based cryptography researchers; a research network will facilitate regular discourse and collaboration between both the European and
international community. 

##### 1.2.2.1 Research Coordination Objectives

1. Lead a global discussion to develop a common vocabulary across the various fields (cryptography, number theory, quantum computing), leading to a shared understanding of both classical and quantum algorithms used in isogeny-based cryptosystems. 

2. Develop the field of isogeny-based cryptography both by improving the understanding of the existing protocols and by developing new protocols.

3. Facilitate access to foundational knowledge in isogeny-based cryptography, both for Early Career Investigators and newcomers to the field. This will include mathematical background, algorithms, and protocol design, and will be achieved for example through open access articles, books, blog posts, audiovisual media, and databases. 

4. Provide input to international standardization bodies such as NIST and ETSI. For example, by writing 'Requests for Comment' (RFCs), technical reports, and filing public comments for the NIST post-quantum competition.

5. Disseminate the work achieved through COST collaborations by presenting at high-profile international cryptography conferences.

##### 1.2.2.2 Capacity-building Objectives

1. Grow the field of isogeny-based cryptography by fostering existing research connections. Most of the innovative papers in the field have resulted from multinational collaborations facilitated by ad hoc workshops or visits; a research network will allow for much more regular collaboration and consequently give rise to a rapid increase in high-quality research output.

2. Foster interdisciplinary approaches by bringing together researchers from cryptography, number theory, and quantum computing, all of whom have different perspectives on the major open problems in isogeny-based cryptography.

3. Give collaboration opportunities and increased visibility to Early Career Investigators who would otherwise be isolated or limited to very few local collaborators by connecting them with the whole European isogeny-based cryptography community.

4. Promote diversity in the community, for example by ensuring a diverse consortium and by collaborating with Women in Numbers Europe.

## 2	NETWORKING EXCELLENCE

### 2.1	Added value of networking in S&T Excellence

Isogeny based cryptography is a relatively young field, which suffers
from geographical dispersion and a small community size. On the other
hand it has grown to a rich enough field that newcomers and the
general public often lack accessible, complete and reliable
information sources. On top of that, isogenies are often regarded as
an exceptionally technical topic within the field of cryptography.

By developing and structuring an international interdisciplinar
network of researchers interested in the topic, providing them with
well organized technical knowledge, powerful tools, and collaboration
venues, the Action will accelerate the development of isogeny based
cryptography, improve understanding, lower entry barriers, and
facilitate industry adoption.

#### 2.1.1	Added value in relation to existing efforts at European and/or international level

We are not aware of any international effort primarily targeting
isogeny-based cryptography, present or past.

The yearly Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) workshop
(https://eccworkshop.org/) has often been the venue where researchers
interested in isogeny based cryptography meet and start
collaborations, and has also served as platform to form Early Career
Investigators through the associated research school.  However the
share of isogeny based cryptography within the event stays somewhat
limited, and can hardly reach all the public target by the Action.

Past European efforts related to the Action are:

- COST Action IC1306, Cryptography for Secure Digital Interaction,
  ended in 2018, bridging together several areas of cryptography.
- COST Action IC1403, CRYPTACUS (https://www.cryptacus.eu/), ended in
  2018, focusing on the security of cryptographic hardware and
  software.
- The H2020 project PQcrypto (https://pqcrypto.eu.org/), ended in
  2018, focusing on candidates to the NIST post-quantum competiton.
- The Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network 643161,
  ECRYPT-NET (https://www.ecrypt.eu.org/), ended in 2019, developing
  advanced cryptographic techniques for the Internet of Things and the
  Cloud, including post-quantum solutions.
- The AlgANT network (http://algant.eu/), a training network targeting
  Masters and PhD in number theory, involving serveral European
  universities.
  
Currently running European efforts related to the action are:

- ERC Grant 669891, Almacrypt (http://www.almacrypt.eu/), which
  mainly focuses on elliptic curve and integer factoring
  cryptanalyses, but has also occasionally touched upon isogeny based
  cryptography.
- ERC Grant 805031, EPOQUE, focusing on
  secure implemenation of NIST post-quantum candidates.

The level of support these past and present project provide to isogeny
based cryptography is very limited. By looking more broadly at public
investments on research in cryptography, it is apparent that
isogeny-based cryptography is underrepresented.  By bringing to life a
coordinated research effort on isogeny based cryptography, the Action
will consolidate Europe's lead on the topic, will bring it to a level
of maturity otherwise hardly achievable, and will bootstrap a virtuous
cycle leading to an increased representation of isogeny based
cryptography in European and international research programmes.


### 2.2	ADDED VALUE OF NETWORKING IN IMPACT

Owing to its small community size, geographical dispersion, and high
degree of interdisciplinarity, it has repeatedly been observed that
the most impactful work in isogeny based cryptography is often the
result of large international collaborations, gathering expertise from
more than one field.

Research on isogeny based cryptography already happens through an
international network, supported by various personal grants on a case
by case basis. However this mode of functioning is exclusive, limiting
participation to a small circle of insiders, holding innovation back,
and potentially leading to stagnation in the field.

By facilitating exchanges, fostering new collaborations, lowering
entry barriers, ensuring diversity, the Action will maximise impact of
isogeny based cryptography, shaping the technological landscape in the
near and long term.


#### 2.2.1	SECURING THE CRITICAL MASS AND EXPERTISE 

Europe already is a leader in isogeny based cryptography, with well
established networks in Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands,
Switzerland, and the UK. However, several isolated researchers work in
other European and Near Neighbouring countries, with limited access to
networks.

The Action brings together researchers from all these countries,
securing the best experts in the field. The research schools and
workshops will let many talented Early Career Researchers meet well
established researchers in the field, fostering new collaborations,
and accelerating the development of isogeny based cryptography by an
order of magnitude.

The Action will pay a particular attention to helping underrepresented
groups join in the research effort. To this end, it will seek the
collaboration of the Women In Number Theory community
(http://womeninnumbertheory.org/) and of the Centre International de
Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées (https://www.cimpa.info/) for
selected workshops.


#### 2.2.2	INVOLVEMENT OF STAKEHOLDERS

The main outputs of the action will be new cryptosystems and
cryptanalyses, which will shape our technological future.  The primary
stakeholders in this effort are standardization bodies, such as NIST
or ETSI, and tech companies working in telecoms, cloud, IoT, etc. The
Action will engage with standardization bodies by publishing
recommendations, whitepapers, requests for comments (RFC), and filing
public comments; members of the action will be encouraged to
participate in standardization panels when relevant.

It is worth mentioning that a number of industrial partners are
already part of the consortium. Building on its industrial component,
the Action will reach to a broader audience in tech companies using a
variety of dissemination channels: talks, technical blog posts,
audio-visual media, open source code, etc. Colocating workshops with
major conferences that attract both an academic and an industrial
audience will further increase impact for these stakeholders.

Finally, universities and other academic institutions offering
graduate programs in cryptography, algebra, number theory and quantum
algorithms will benefit from the educational material published by the
action, such as books and audio-visual content.


#### 2.2.3	MUTUAL BENEFITS OF THE INVOLVEMENT OF SECONDARY PROPOSERS FROM NEAR NEIGHBOUR OR INTERNATIONAL PARTNER COUNTRIES OR INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS

Beyond Europe, the countries with the strongest networks in isogeny
based cryptography are Canada, Japan, and the US. The involvement of
these partners as secondary proposers is thus a natural step towards
building a truly inclusive research network. The partnership will make
it easier to disseminate the outputs of the Action to these
international countries, and, reciprocally, it will help keep Action
members informed on activities happening outside of Europe.


## 3	IMPACT

The aim of the Action is to expand the impact of isogenies on future
communication technologies. By creating the conditions to adopt,
safely and cost-effectively, isogeny-based protocols in future
communication protocols, the Action will positively impact the
competitiveness of SMEs and large companies in Europe and beyond.

The action will seek to maximise impact by disseminating results in
written form (books, academic papers, whitepapers, blog posts), and by
training a new generation of young researchers and engineers in the
fundamental tools of isogeny-based cryptography.


### 3.1	IMPACT TO SCIENCE, SOCIETY AND COMPETITIVENESS, AND POTENTIAL FOR INNOVATION/BREAK-THROUGHS

#### 3.1.1	SCIENTIFIC, TECHNOLOGICAL, AND/OR SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACTS (INCLUDING POTENTIAL INNOVATIONS AND/OR BREAKTHROUGHS)

NIST's eventual standardization of SIKE, possibly at some point within
the time frame of the Action, or shortly thereafter, is the first
clear impact factor tied to the Action. Through its published
analyses, the Action will aim at influencing NIST's decision
process. Two outcomes are possible: either the analyses shed doubt on
the security of SIKE, an unfortunate outcome, but a valuable
contribution to NIST and to society; or they confirm the strength of
SIKE, and possibly improve its performance, paving the way for
widespread adoption as well as growth in the sector of
post-quantum cryptography.

While the eventual standardization of SIKE will be an undeniable
booster for the popularity of isogeny-based cryptogrpahy, the Action
goals reach beyond NIST's competition and post-quantum
cryptography alone. 

Within the scope of post-quantum cryptography, the Action will 
explore many significant innovations, such as, for
example, efficient isogeny-based signature schemes, new advanced
primitives not currently known to be constructible from isogenies,
better provable security for already known primitives, and more
in-depth analyses of available attacks. Although on a longer
time-scale than SIKE, these innovations will directly benefit
stakeholders operating in the post-quantum space such as SMEs and
large companies offering encrypted products with long-term security.

Beyond post-quantum cryptography, the recently discovered "time delay
protocols" based on isogenies offer another opportunity for high
impact, providing cost-effective solutions to difficult problems in
distributed computing such as generation of fair randomness or
electronic voting. The primary beneficiaries of these technologies are
stakeholders working with blockchains, and more generally financial
services. The Action will advance the state-of-the-art of time delay
protocols, providing more powerful constructions, more efficient
protocols, and more secure instantiations.

Finally, in terms of scientific impact, the goal of the action is to
establish a common language and to reach a critical mass capable of
accelerating progress in isogeny-based cryptography. The various
actions described in the implementation section (workshops, schools,
books) will contribute to form a new generation of experts with a deep
understanding of isogeny-based cryptography, whose impact in the
broader field of cryptography ---both theoretical and applied--- will be felt
well after the Action is over.

### 3.2	MEASURES TO MAXIMISE IMPACT

#### 3.2.1	KNOWLEDGE CREATION, TRANSFER OF KNOWLEDGE AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT

Owing to its interdisciplinary nature, and to the wide range of skills
involved, the Action will alternate large meetings aimed at all
partners and smaller focused meetings gathering participants from one
or two Working Groups.

Concretely, the Action will be structured around yearly meetings, in
rotating locations, aimed at all participants and open to outside
researchers. The meeting will have both an educational component, in
the form of lectures, and a research one, in the form of contributed
talks, posters, and work sessions. To encourage outside participation,
the Action will seek to co-locate the meetings with related
conferences, e.g., Eurocrypt or ANTS. Lecturers will be encouraged to
write lecture notes, and the notes will be collected on the website of
the Action [Luca: or shall we try to publish proceedings?] 
[Chloe: nice idea, but do we want to promise that now already?]. Whenever
technically possible, measures will be taken to also encourage remote
participation; at a minimum, lectures will be recorded and made
available online shortly after the workshop.

Between yearly meetings, the action will organize smaller workshops or
schools focused on narrower topics, typically involving one or two
Working Groups. The workshops will primarily be targeted at Action
members, but will be open to anyone, within the capacity of the event.
Whenever feasible, these workshops will be organized in participating
Inclusiveness Target Countries, to facilitate participation of their
researchers. The format of the workshop will be decided by
the organizers, and will have to be validated by the Management
Committee.

Both for meetings and workshops, the
Action will strive to involve young researchers in their
organization, in particular from Inclusiveness Target Countries, to
encourage responsibility taking and network building.

A limited amount of Short-Term Scientific Missions and Conference
Grants will be reserved to encourage PhD students to visit other
institutions and develop scientific collaborations.


#### 3.2.2	PLAN FOR DISSEMINATION AND/OR EXPLOITATION AND DIALOGUE WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR POLICY

Throughout the duration of the Action, the official website will serve as a one stop shop for all sorts of resources related to the Action. In particular, it will contain:

- News feeds, agenda, links to mailing lists and social media accounts providing informations on the Action's activities.

- A regularly updated blog (1 post per month on average at least) discussing scientific topics related to the Action using an informal style.

- A database of all scientific publications in the field of isogeny based cryptography, both by Action members and non-members, searchable and downloadable in machine readable formats.

- Lecture material from the Action's meetings and workshops.

- Information on the management of the Action.

The website will be maintained for at least 4 years after the end of the action. We aim for it to become a standard source of information for the field, and be kept up to date in the long term.

In the last year of the Action, selected lectures from the schools, plus invited essays if necessary,
will be considered to become chapters of a book edited under the
supervision of the Action and published with an academic publisher.

The Action will disseminate its scientic discoveries through the usual academic channels. Gold open access will be the preferred publication model; fortunately, this is often the standard model in the appropriate communities. Should the action publish datasets (e.g., tables of polynomials, formulas, ...), these will be published according to open data practices. The action will generally not seek to establish patents, as these are typically considered a hindrance to the deployment of cryptosystems. Exceptions may be made when a member seeks to establish a "defensive patent"; in this case the member will be required to explicitly release the patent to the public domain royalty-free.

The Action will target strategic venues for its communications: major conferences and journals in cryptography and number theory, targeted workshops on post-quantum cryptography, and standardization body meetings. In particular, the Action will target the workshops regularly organized by NIST as part of the post-quantum competition, by submitting whitepapers and contributed talks.

Software produced by the Action will mostly consist of research software for demonstrative purposes, or contributions to open source computer algebra systems (e.g., PARI/GP, Sagemath, Oscar, ...). In both cases, the code will be published under standard open source licenses, such as the GPL. Occasionally, some of these software may be integrated in the products of the industrial partners of the Action. As a general rule, the open source license will still apply to the software; most companies in cryptography regularly work with open source software. If the open source license does cause a problem with an industrial partner however, the authors of the code may decide to grant an additional closed source license to the industrial partner.

Besides advancing the state-of-the-art, the action also aims at making isogeny-based cryptography accessible to as wide an audience as possible. The blog will be the primary communication medium targeted at the general public, and shall thus be rich in expository informal articles and links to further reading. A series of short introductory videos targeting Masters and PhD students will be recorded to complement the lectures given at schools.


## 4	IMPLEMENTATION
### 4.1	COHERENCE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE WORK PLAN
#### 4.1.1	DESCRIPTION OF WORKING GROUPS, TASKS AND ACTIVITIES

Due to its multidisciplinary nature, the Action brings together several communities with different expertise and vocabularies. The work plan will be structured around 4 Working Groups (WG), roughly corresponding to each of the communities. We describe the WG below.

**WG1 - Number theoretic foundations** This WG will be concerned with the mathematical foundations of isogeny-based cryptography, rooted in number theory and algebraic geometry. It will study the objects upon which cryptographic protocols are built, their generalisations and their algorithmic properties. In particular, it will research efficient algorithms for working with isogenies of elliptic curves and higher dimensional abelian varieties, the structure of isogeny graphs, and the algorithmic relationships with their endomorphism rings. Its outputs will inform the other working groups on the best algorithmic ways to reach their goals, and on the potential risks to security. From the other WG, it will draw inspiration for useful properties to look for in the algebraic objects.

**WG2 - Cryptanalysis** This WG will focus on algorithms to break the concrete schemes that have been proposed. It shares with WG1 an interest for algorithms to navigate isogeny graphs, however it approaches them from a cryptographic perspective, focusing on the security definitions and the minor details that make each system unique. Unlike other WGs, it will have a strong focus on quantum algorithms. Security reductions will also be an object of study of this WG, in collaboration with WG3. Its outputs will be used to set parameters for different security levels, in coordination with WG4.

**WG3 - Primitives, Protocols and Assumptions** This WG will research new primitives and protocols that can be built from isogenies. It will monitor the emergence of new primitives that have a potential to be built from isogenies, and inform other WGs in the hope of coming with a working proposal. It will construct new protocols (mostly advanced ones that go beyond encryption and signatures) using the available primitives, and seek to make them as efficient as possible in collaboration with WG4. Inspired by protocols in other subfields (e.g., lattice based cryptography), it will propose new isogeny-based assumptions upon which new protocols can be constructed, and assess their security in collaboration with WG1 and WG2.

**WG4 - Hardware & Software implementations** This WG will produce high efficiency implementations of isogeny algorithms and protocols, both in hardware and in software. It will discuss with WG2 to determine the most efficient parameters for a given security level. It will interact with WG1 to seek new theoretically efficient algorithms for isogeny computations, that translate into fast software and hardware.

[We need to say something about transversality, risk management, and how we make the WG talk to each other]
