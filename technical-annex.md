# TECHNICAL ANNEX

## 1	S&T EXCELLENCE

### 1.1	Soundness of the Challenge 

TODO: Ben

#### 1.1.1	DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE-OF-THE-ART
#### 1.1.2	DESCRIPTION OF THE CHALLENGE (MAIN AIM)


### 1.2	Progress beyond the state-of-the-art 

TODO: Chloe

#### 1.2.1	APPROACH TO THE CHALLENGE AND PROGRESS BEYOND THE STATE-OF-THE-ART
#### 1.2.2	Objectives

**TODO** add some buzzwordy bits. Include ECIs, geographical and gender diversity.

##### 1.2.2.1 Research Coordination Objectives

Note: other COST actions have way more generic buzzwordy objectives than this. Bullets below are a first attempt at putting what we discussed down

- Developing the field of isogeny-based cryptography both by improving the understanding of the existing protocols and by developing new protocols.
- Leading the development of a common understanding internationally of both classical and quantum algorithms applied to isogeny-based cryptosystems.
- Create an open-source database of isogeny formulas. This naturally complements and can be included in the already widely-used Explicit Formulas Database (https://hyperelliptic.org/EFD/). **TODO** check with Tanja.
- Write a book on isogeny-based cryptography covering the basic topics needed for a newcomer to the topic to start doing research in the area.
- Disseminate the work acheived through COST collaborations by presenting at high-profile international cryptography conferences such as Eurocrypt.
- **TODO** add something about NIST. Along the lines of: Confidence in the security of SIKE is becoming an urgent question, and has not been studied on anything near the level of competitors, add quote from round 3?

What we discussed:
- Dissemination
- Development of common understanding
- Input to marketers
- Input to stakeholders (e.g., NIST)?
- Data curation?

##### 1.2.2.2 Capacity-building Objectives

- Growing the field of isogeny-based cryptography by fostering existing research connections. As this is an emerging field, no one country has a critical mass of isogeny-based cryptography reseachers. Most of the innovative papers (about 1 per year) resulted from multinational collaboration, and a research network will allow for a rapid increase in research output.
- Bringing together reseachers from cryptography, number theory, and quantum computing, all of whom have relevant and different perspectives on the major open problems in isogeny-based cryptography.
- Allowing Early Career Investigators who would otheriwse be isolated or limited to very few local collaborators to connect with the whole European isogeny-based cryptography community.
- Promoting and supporting female and non-binary researchers in the field, both by a having a diverse consortium with respect to gender (at each level of involvement), and by collaboration with the Women in Numbers Europe community.

What we discussed:
- Bridging fields
- Building new stuff
